# Owen's Dotfiles

Welcome! This is my personal `.dotfiles` repository where I keep all my dotfiles and configuration.
Feel free to browse around, take inspiration, or use anything you find helpful.

## What's Inside

This repository contains my carefully curated setup for a productive and pleasant development environment.
At its heart, you'll find:

- **zsh** - My shell of choice
- **neovim** - My primary text editor
- **Ghostty** - A fast, modern terminal emulator (although I do like **kitty** too...)
- **And more** - Additional tools and configurations that make my workflow, well, my workflow

## Getting Started

If you'd like to use any of these configs:

1. Browse through the files to see what interests you
2. Copy individual config files or sections that you find useful
3. Adapt them to your own needs and preferences

**Note:**
These are my personal configurations, so they're tailored to my workflow.
I recommend reviewing and understanding what each config does before applying it to your system.

## Philosophy

I believe in keeping configurations clean, well-commented, and modular.
If something here helps you improve your own setup, that makes me happy!
Don't hesitate to modify anything to fit your needs.

## Contributing

While this is a personal configuration repository, I'm always open to suggestions!
If you spot a bug, have an optimization idea, or want to share a cool trick,
feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## License

These configurations are shared freely. Use them however you'd like!

Happy configuring! 🎉
